            I have spent a lot of time, for learning in IT sphere,
            but became interested programming some time ago.
            On this way i have met some problems, but never gave up,
            and i have a lot of targets, such as writing cryptocurrency.
            My approach is concluded in peace and rest,
            so at this time I tried to collect useful knowledge.
            Hopefully we can help each other,
            and i will not justify himself, because i'm too weak.

            I had some work and orders on private boards,
            and know linux - based system, like Azure / Amazon services.
            Was interested on network technology stack,
            and received practical experience command development.
            Have low or middle language level,
            "I'll try my best, but my best wasn't good enough" :)
            I will try work harder, just give me chance;
            Thank for your patience. Sorry for my "pride approach".
